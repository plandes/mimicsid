HPI: This is a first office visit to my clinic by Mrs. Jame Smith, a very pleasant
59-year-old F patient, who sustained in 1983, as the result of 2 ski accidents,
a pelvic fracture with vertical shear that has healed in about an inch vertical
shortening.

Social History:
Chinese speaking only. Immigrated 2 years ago with help of
mother and brother.  Does not speak to either at this time.
